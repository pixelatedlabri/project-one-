// Stacking Blocks is a game inspired by Tetris Game built on grid 

Tetris is a classic arcade game created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov. The game requires players to rotate and move falling Tetris pieces. Players clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty cells. If the pieces reach the top, the game is over.

Phase I: I set up the grid and figure out how to move the object down the grid. Maybe setInterval before or after to play around with it or could add movement in after set interval. 

Set up Tetrominoes 
    / Event Listeners: 
    / KeyRight(moves the object to the right)
    / KeyLeft (moves the object to the left)
    /KeyUp (rotates the object)
    /KeyDown (moves object immediately to the bottom of the grid)
    detectCollisions of one object with the next (assign class taken )
    clearBottomLine (clears bottom line and adds 100 points to the score)
    Reset Function
    Reset Button 


Set up the prototype with grid to try. 
Set up the prototype with canvas to try. 

Phase II: comment out code for first object
          create second object
          repeat steps for first object and develop the keys for that object 


Phase III: comment out code for first and second object and develop third object 
            repeat steps for first object
            and develop key settings for that object

Phase IV: add sound button 
          sound for each object as it appears on the screen
          sound for the clearing of the bottomline

Phase V: creating the random object generator

Stretch Goals: if I have time, make a fourth object
               add cool sound to the game
