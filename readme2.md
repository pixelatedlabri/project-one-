## Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Javascript, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

## Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Be built on a grid**, or if you're brave, use HTML Canvas
- **Design logic for winning** and **visually display which player won**
- **Allow for restarting the game** without reloading the browser
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will do this together at the end of the project)
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working game, built by you**, hosted with GitHub pages (we'll show how to do this early next week)
- A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. Update as you go along – you can include wireframes, pseudocode, and complete this after your project.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
- Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game whenever you can.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. Git is a time machine for your code. Run `git log --oneline` to see that timeline.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, classwork notes, previous homeworks, stack overflow etc.) to advance your understanding and extend your project.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  - This is incredibly important. Don't aim for the final version on Day 1. Create the minimum viable product (MVP) version of your code. Extend it. Extend it again. Throw away code once you're not using it.
  - Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
  - Break your tasks into functions, test those functions manually, and then wire them up to the right events when you're ready.
